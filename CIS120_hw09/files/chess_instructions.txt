Chess Instructions

Welcome to Sam's Chess Game! 
This game seeks to model the classic game as closely as possible. 
Just like the board game, White plays first. 
The usual limitations on piece movement apply. 

At the bottom of the game panel, 
the current player is shown; make sure you don't grab 
a piece from the other team!

In addition to these instructions, 
there are handy buttons on the side that provide 
functionality to quit and reset the game.

How to play: on your turn, select the piece that 
you wish to move by clicking it, 
then click on the square you wish to move to. 
If the move is valid, the piece will move to the 
destination square.
